        Every year, USF hosts a national "Welcoming Week" event to
        embrace the contributions of refugees and immigrants to American
        communities. The theme this year was Small Shoes, Big Journey to
        embrace the children that now call Tampa home.
      </p>
      <h4>My Role</h4>
      <p>
        I volunteered all day to capture the event and all of the
        various activities held throughout the day. I then edited the
        footage together to create this montage to help showcase the
        diversity of the Tampa Bay community, as well as promote this
        amazing event in years to come.
