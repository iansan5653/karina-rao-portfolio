          <p>
            Every year, USF hosts a national "Welcoming Week" event to
            embrace the contributions of refugees and immigrants to American
            communities. The theme this year was Small Shoes, Big Journey to
            embrace the children that now call Tampa home.
          </p>
          <h4>My Role</h4>
          <p>
            I volunteered all day to capture the event and all of the
            various activities held throughout the day. I then edited the
            footage together to create this montage to help showcase the
            diversity of the Tampa Bay community, as well as promote this
            amazing event in years to come.
