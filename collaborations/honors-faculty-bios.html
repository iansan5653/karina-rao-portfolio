        The Honors College faculty are an impressive bunch of
        hard-working and extremely intelligent, creative, and insightful
        individuals. This series of videos shares the educational
        backgrounds of the instructors, classes they teach at the Honors
        College, and a parting wisdom they would like to instill in
        their students.

        filmed, and edited 9 faculty bio videos
