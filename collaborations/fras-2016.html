        The Florida Resident Assistant Seminar (FRAS) is a three day
        event held each year in a Florida school. The 2016 seminar was
        hosted by the Florida Institute of Technology in Melbourne,
        Florida, and is aimed to showcase the work that Residential
        Assistants (RA's) do on their respective campuses.

      <h4>My Role</h4>
      <p>
        I was recruited to make a promotional video about the USF-Tampa
        RA's on the recommendation of Greg Bowers, the USF Housing and
        Residential Assistant Director. I filmed and edited this short
        film in accordance to the 2016 FRAS theme - boardgames.
