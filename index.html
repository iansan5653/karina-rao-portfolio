                The USF Honors College takes students every year to different
                countries around the world. Many of the trips are extensions of
                Honors classes where students learn about the country and
                culture beforehand, and then have a first-hand learning
                experience.

                Interview students who went on the Honors trips and blend their
                responses, pictures, and videos to create a video to promote the
                trip to future students.

                The Honors College faculty are an impressive bunch of
                hard-working and extremely intelligent, creative, and insightful
                individuals. This series of videos shares the educational
                backgrounds of the instructors, classes they teach at the Honors
                College, and a parting wisdom they would like to instill in
                their students.

              <h4>My Role</h4>
              <p>
                I initiated this video series and came up with questions,
                filmed, and edited 9 faculty bio videos

                Every year, USF hosts a national "Welcoming Week" event to
                embrace the contributions of refugees and immigrants to American
                communities. The theme this year was Small Shoes, Big Journey to
                embrace the children that now call Tampa home.
              </p>
              <h4>My Role</h4>
              <p>
                I volunteered all day to capture the event and all of the
                various activities held throughout the day. I then edited the
                footage together to create this montage to help showcase the
                diversity of the Tampa Bay community, as well as promote this
                amazing event in years to come.

                The Florida Resident Assistant Seminar (FRAS) is a three day
                event held each year in a Florida school. The 2016 seminar was
                hosted by the Florida Institute of Technology in Melbourne,
                Florida, and is aimed to showcase the work that Residential
                Assistants (RA's) do on their respective campuses.
              </p>
              <h4>My Role</h4>
              <p>
                I was recruited to make a promotional video about the USF-Tampa
                RA's on the recommendation of Greg Bowers, the USF Housing and
                Residential Assistant Director. I filmed and edited this short
                film in accordance to the 2016 FRAS theme - boardgames.
